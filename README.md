# Bees 🐝

Welcome to the **Bees** Flutter project! This project was developed as part of an assignment for the Flutter position at Bees Software Solutions Pvt Ltd.

The app follows the **MVVM architecture** with **GetX** for state management, uses **Dio** for handling networking (API calls), and **Hive** for local storage.

## 🚀 Features

- **State Management**: GetX (following the MVVM pattern)
- **Networking**: Dio for API requests
- **Local Storage**: Hive for persistent data storage
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) for clean and maintainable code
